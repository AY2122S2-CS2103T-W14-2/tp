### 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### 3.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 3.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores `Note` objects in three separate lists for each `Person` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### 3.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **4. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 Contact Management

#### 4.1.1 Add Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to add persons to the person list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#addPerson()` to add a new person to the person list.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `add-p n/Johnson p/83918273 a/Woodlands Avenue 4 e/johnson@gmail.com` to add a new person to the person list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `AddPersonCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `AddPersonCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#addPerson()` is called which adds the new person to an internal list and updates the GUI display. A new contact named "Johnson" with his relevant details is then shown in the person list.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![AddPersonSequenceDiagram](images/AddPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be an abstraction for persons:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate `add-p` command for creating a person.
    * Pros: Easy to extend and modify.
    * Cons: Not as intuitive for the user.
* **Alternative 2:** Single `add` command that adds tasks/persons depending on parameters.
    * Pros: More intuitive for the user.

#### 4.1.2 Delete Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to delete persons from the person list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#deletePerson()` to delete a person from the person list. The method `#setTask()` is also called to ensure that the deleted person is removed from all tasks.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the delete person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `del-p 1` to delete the first person in the person list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `DeletePersonCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `DeletePersonCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#setTask()` method is called multiple times to remove the
corresponding person from all the tasks in the task list. After which, the `ModelManager#deletePerson()` method is called to delete the specified person from the person list.

Step 5: The GUI display is then updated to show a new contact and task list without the deleted person.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![DeletePersonSequenceDiagram](images/DeletePersonSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be an abstraction for persons:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate `del-p` command for deleting a person.
    * Pros: Easy to extend and modify.
    * Cons: Not as intuitive for the user.
* **Alternative 2:** Single `del` command that deletes tasks/persons depending on parameters.
    * Pros: More intuitive for the user.

#### 4.1.3 Edit Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to edit persons from the person list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#setPerson()` to update a person from the person list. If the person's name is edited in this process, the method `#setTask()` will be called to ensure all tasks tagged with this person is updated according.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the edit person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `edit-p 1 n/Johnson` to edit the first person in the person list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `EditPersonCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `EditPersonCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#setTask()` method is called multiple times to update the
name of the corresponding person in all the tasks. After which, the `ModelManager#setPerson()` method is called to update the specified person in the person list.

Step 5: The GUI display is then updated to show a new contact and task list with the updated person details.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![EditPersonSequenceDiagram](images/EditPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be an abstraction for persons:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate `edit-p` command for editing a person.
    * Pros: Easy to extend and modify.
    * Cons: Not as intuitive for the user.
* **Alternative 2:** Single `edit` command that edits tasks/persons depending on parameters.
    * Pros: More intuitive for the user.

#### 4.1.4 Clear Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows users to clear all persons from the person list.
It is facilitated by the `ModelManager` which sets a new `AddressBook` object to the `ModelManager` to clear the person list. The method `#setTask()` will also be called to ensure all tasks do not have any persons tagged to it.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the clear person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `clear-p` to clear all persons from the person list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into the `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable
parser class which corresponds with the provided command to parse the user's inputs.

Step 3: Since there are no arguments for this command, a newly initialised `ClearPersonCommand` is returned to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#setTask()` method is called multiple times to delete persons in all the tasks. After which, a new `AddressBook` object is passed into the `ModelManager#setAddressBook()` method which clears out the person list. 

Step 5: The GUI display is then updated to show an empty contact and new task list without any persons tagged to the tasks.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![ClearPersonSequenceDiagram](images/ClearPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be separate clear commands for clearing tasks and persons:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A separate command for clearing tasks and persons.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Hard to extend.
* **Alternative 2:** A combined command for clearing tasks and persons.
  earPer  * Pros: Easier and more intuitive for the user to understand
    * Cons: Hard to implement.

#### 4.1.5 Add Tags Feature

##### Implementation
This feature allows the user to add tags to contacts in the list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#setPerson()` and `#updateFilteredPersonList()` to add tags to a contact.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `tag-add-p 1 friend` to add the tag "friend" to the first contact in the list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `AddTagCommandParser` where its method `#parse` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `AddTagCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution. This `AddTagCommand` contains information about the new tag (in this case, "friend")

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#setPerson()` is called which edits the tags of the person with the user-supplied tags. The filtered person list is updated with `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList` to display the new information to the user.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![AddTagSequenceDiagram](images/AddTagSequenceDiagram.png)


##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should the implementation use the existing edit functionalities in AB3:**
* **Alternative 1:**  Use the current EditCommand class to edit a person's tags.
    * Pros: Maintains abstraction and reuses code instead of writing new code.
    * Cons: Creates a cyclic dependency, making the code base harder to maintain later on

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Implement AddTagCommand independently, rewriting similar code
    * Pros: Cleaner code and less dependencies
    * Cons: Repetitive code that is not abstracted

#### 4.1.6 Find Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to display selected persons in the contact list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which 
makes use of the method `#updateFilteredPersonList()` to find persons by name or tag.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the find person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `find n/Alex t/friends` to find selected persons.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `FindPersonCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs. 

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `FindPersonCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList()` is called which updates the GUI display with only selected persons shown in the contact list. The command results are then generated and shown to the user.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![FindPersonSequenceDiagram](images/FindPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the export command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `export` to into the command line to export the current strategy board.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable 
parser class to process the user inputs. 

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `ExportCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `CommandResult` object is returned to the `MainWindow`,
where `MainWindow#captureAndSaveStrategyPanel()` is called to capture an image of the strategy board. 
The user is then prompted to choose a directory from their local disk to save the image in, and hence the picture is saved locally.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![ExportCommandDiagram](images/ExportCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be a predetermined location and randomly generated file names for the images:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User is prompted to select their local directory and filename of choice.
    * Pros: Allows users to categorize and structure their filenames according to their preferences.
    * Cons: Hard to guarantee execution on user end.
* **Alternative 2:** A directory is created in-app with randomly generated file names`.
    * Pros: Easier for users as they have less work to do.
    * Cons: Hard to organize and structure.
